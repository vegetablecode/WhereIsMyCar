# WhereIsMyCar

## What it is?
This is an iOS app, that can help you in finding your's own car in a car park. It's built in Flutter. I wanted to test how Cupertiono widgets look like and how to use them. I also wanted to learn how to use Google Maps API to get user's localization and display the map. It works pretty fine, I guess.
